On Yelp, when you click on on the "Open Now" filter, an "open_now" parameter is added to the URL. This open_now parameter seems to be the number of minutes from midnight on Monday, that is the start of Monday. This project is a simple web page that has three fields you can scroll to select the day of the week, the hour of the day, and the minutes of the hour. When you select a value in any of these fields and click on Calculate, the open_now parameter is updated to reflect the number to which you can change the URL parameter. This was tested in HST so I don't know if it is timezone specific or not. I assume it is just a local time to your location of search.
